This is the worst I've
been since I've been home
Tried to quit, been a week,
need a quick pull
This is the worst I've
been since I've been old
Stealing bottles from
the basement
Hard to recreate
The way I felt when
I was seventeen
I'll keep trying if it kills me,
baby
Suburbia feels the same as
it used to
Park the bike, wipe the sweat,
what's it come to?
I'm facing the summer of
my senior
All the bridges I crossed
are burned
I'll be honest, I wasn't perfect
I'll be honest,
you weren't either
I draw my line in the sand,
the sand
Coming from a high on the
first of July
I couldn't read your mind
I couldn't read your mind
Haven't thought for a while
Really can't deny that
I think about the time
I think about the time
I crossed your mind
I crossed your mind
I crossed your mind
Yeah-yeah
This is the first I took in
the fresh air
Down the block on my walk
from the beach stairs
This is the first I've
noticed the small tears
Taking bottles from the basement
Hard to recreate
The way I felt when
I was seventeen
I'll keep trying if it kills me,
baby
Coming from a high on the
first of July
I couldn't read your mind
I couldn't read your mind
Haven't thought for a while
Really can't deny that
I think about the time
I think about the time
I crossed your mind
I crossed your mind
I crossed your mind
Yeah-yeah
(Did I?)
Ooh, I crossed your mind
Ooh, I crossed your mind
Ooh, I crossed your mind
Ooh, I crossed your mind
Ooh, I crossed your mind
Ooh, I crossed your mind
Ooh, I crossed your mind
Ooh, I crossed your mind
Ooh, I crossed your mind
