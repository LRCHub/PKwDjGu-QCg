Sometimes I go walkin' through the fields
Where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used-to-be
And the flowers still grow
But they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me
And when I think of you
And the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old mem'ries like that
Or do ever I cross your mind

Oh how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
How often I long for those two lovin' arms
That once held me so gentle and close

And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old mem'ries at all
Or do I ever cross your mind

And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old mem'ries at all
Or do I ever cross your mind

Jazz hands
Jazz hands
Jazz hands to the finish
